"3314",79,"Teflon Don","Rick Ross","Losing none of the momentum put in motion by his 2009 effort, Deeper Than Rap, Rick Ross keeps a very good thing going on Teflon Don, arguably his best album to date. You want rap-style luxury? Then Deeper is the better fit, but Teflon plays up the chilled and soulful elements of its predecessor, meaning Ross has graduated to a level where words like âorganicâ and âpoignantâ come into play. The former is best represented by âMayback Music IIIâ and itâs swirling, â70s-flavored dreamscape created by the J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League production team. Ross allows guests T.I. and Jadakiss to go first on the cut, then grabs his cigar for an uplifting story of ghetto triumph that goes from pushing to pleasing the folks (âParents never had a good job/Now itâs black American Express cards""). When it comes to âpoignant,â the evidence is dotted throughout the album with the rapper reflecting on where heâs been, and he often questions his own lust for fame. He chants the title to the opening âIâm Not a Starâ as if it was a remindful mantra, but itâs his new love of contrasts thatâs really interesting, following Kanyeâs swaggering on âLive Fast, Die Youngâ with âSeems to me we gettinâ money for the wrong things/Look around, Maseratis for the whole team/Look at Haiti, children dyinâ round the clock/Iâd send a hundred grand but thatâs a decent watchâ. The familiar party and thugging tunes work too with âB.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast),â âNo. 1,â and the mixtape favorite âMC Hammerâ -- now with added Gucci Mane verse -- all coming correct. Add all the Illuminati references in the Jay-Z team-up (âFree Masonâ), a decent smoking song (âSuper Highâ), and a track where Cee-Loâs performance just might make you misty (âTears of Joyâ), and itâs obvious Rossâ albums are no longer just vessels for his singles. ~ David Jeffries","7.0","/music/teflon-don/rick-ross",2010-07-20

"4109",78,"Part II: The New December","The Booksman","Fol Chen continues to embrace mystery and avoid the obvious on Part II: The New December. As on Part I: John Shade, Your Fortuneâs Made, the enigmatic band makes a virtue out of indirectness, sending songs through secret passages and tunnels that end in hooks some distance from where they were expected. Thereâs a strong experimental streak in the brainy way Fol Chen takes what seems like a straightforward idea and twists it into something completely different; like the Dirty Projectors, the group flirts with and subverts mainstream pop ideas, and like labelmates Cryptacize, theyâve got a flair for the deceptively simple. The band goes even further down the rabbit hole than on Part I, beginning The New December with some of its strangest music. âIn Ruinsâ contrasts deep, whispered vocals with lively girlish ones atop busy keyboards playing busy, vaguely Eastern-tinged melodies; âYour Curtain Callâ begins with breathy beats and woozy flutes, expanding into bells and a drunken sax solo before pulling back again; and âMen, Houses or Beastsâ tiptoes so slowly that it almost sounds like it was recorded at the wrong speed. Fittingly for a band so committed to disguising its identity, some of The New Decemberâs best songs deal with miscommunication and missed connections. On âThe Holograms,â a tale of forgotten names and words doubling into optical illusions, bounces along on one of the albumâs catchiest melodies, while the excellent âC/Uâ keeps its lovers apart despite its almost perversely straightforward beat. Likewise, the band buries some of its best songs on the albumâs second half: âAdeline (You Always Look so Bored)ââs sharp-tongued chamber pop recalls St. Vincentâs abundant musical and lyrical wit, and âThey Came to Meâ boasts rubbery beats that are just as danceable as they are strange, and could be heard at a club with a trampoline for a dancefloor. How exactly these songs fit together with âHolesââ delicate plucking and the title trackâs pixelated folk might be locked in Fol Chenâs brains, but even if there are more pieces of their puzzle-pop missing here than there were on John Shade, Your Fortuneâs Made, The New December is never boring. ~ Heather Phares","tbd","/music/part-ii-the-new-december/fol-chen",2010-06-22

"5350",76,"Masts of Manhatta","Tracy Bonham","Tracy Bonhamâs career trajectory seems to run in reverse; with each record, she gets riskier, coming a long, long way from the bottled-up furious angst of her â90s alt-rock staple âMother Mother.â Masts of Manhatta, her fourth album and first since 2005âs Blink the Brightest, ups the ante from that haunting record by accentuating its elliptical turns, its songs dodging conventional routes in favor of left turns. Bonham is assisted greatly by Beck guitarist Smokey Hormel and his trio, who lend her songs earthiness and art, giving this heft and welcome unpredictability. To an extent, Bonham lays out her albumâs thesis on âWe Moved Our City to the Country,â a knowing satire of hipsters fleeing the urban jungle for faux authenticity, where she feels the pull of the two extremes as evidenced by how her sawing violin contrasts with the cabaret shuffle of Hormelâs group. Masts of Manhatta walks this line throughout, sometimes getting quite a bit livelier, sometimes indulging in decidedly moody textures, always twisting just slightly from the expected, making for a record thatâs quite intriguing upon the first listen and better on repeats, where the songs begin to dig in and all the textures gain resonance. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine","tbd","/music/masts-of-manhatta/tracy-bonham",2010-07-13

"6867",74,"Dillatronic","J Dilla","Curated by his mother, Ma Dukes, Dillatronic offers 41 rare instrumentals from the late Detroit hip-hop producer James ""J Dilla"" Yancey, with the focus being on his ""electronic music influences,"" who are as much Kraftwerk as George Clinton. Case in point, the funky, slinky track seven included here -- none of the tracks are titled -- which slowly rocks back and forth like Clinton's solo hit ""Atomic Dog,"" while the 26th cut comes off as a cross between Madlib and ""Maggot Brain"" with Funkadelic guitars spinning and swaying in a psychedelic manner. The latter track also strays from the ""electronic music influences"" concept, which happens with about a quarter of the album's tracks. Good thing too, as the chugging and organic track three is a much bigger surprise than the half-speed redo of ""Trans Europe Express"" that is track 20, plus the drifting, Janet Jackson-esque closer has little to do with electro but is likely to become a favorite with the target audience (a combination of the Dilla faithful, underground beatheads, and amateur MCs looking for mixtape productions). While the collection doesn't come with the purposeful feel of Donuts, it flows extremely well for a beat tape, and one released nine years after the artist passed. Add to that the amount of new flavors and unexpected twists (Was track 12 influenced by early dubstep? What was the plan for the dark and dense track 28?) plus crisp, clean recordings that beat the bootlegs, and Dillatronic is a necessary pickup for fans. ~ David Jeffries","tbd","/music/dillatronic/j-dilla",2015-10-30

"6985",73,"Minotaur","The Clientele","The Clienteleâs 2009 album Bonfires on the Heath was one of the best, most hauntingly beautiful records of the bandâs impressive career. So strong that it spawned an equally wonderful EP made up of songs recorded at the Bonfires sessions that were deemed suitable for the album itself. Hard to believe that they couldnât find room for the title track ""Minotaur"" as its fragile melody and sweetly swaying dynamics would have fit in perfectly. The same with the bouncing and sweet ""Paul Verlaine""; it would have been one of the more memorable tracks there. That these songs were indeed left off only points out how good Bonfires was, and how easily the Clientele concoct note-perfect autumnal pop. Add in a moodily drifting cover of The West Coast Pop Art Experiment's creepy ballad from the late 60s,âAs the World Rises and Falls,â a couple of tracks that hit the usual Clientele sweet spot between heartbreak and tender melancholy, and a long spoken word ramble from leader Alasdair MacLean, and you have a record that rises above stopgap or left-overs status. Minotaur is as essential as anything else the band has released and whether as part of Bonfires or on its own, the record stands as a welcome addition to their legacy as one of the great indie pop bands of their era. ~ Tim Sendra","tbd","/music/minotaur/the-clientele",2010-08-31

"8810",70,"Perch Patchwork","Maps & Atlases","Maps & Atlasesâ second EP, You and Me and the Mountain, found the band moving in a lighter direction than the mathematical frenzy of their first EP Trees, Swallows, Houses. Their first full-length sees them fully morphed into a sophisticated indie pop group. Perch Patchwork is a bold debut, filled with bombastic arrangements, twisting modal progressions, and percussive layers. The skill set is high, but itâs far less showy. Guitarists will still be enthralled by Dave Davidson's and Erin Elders' fingertapping, but acoustics take precedent, and moderately slow tempos maintain the album's balladic feel. If Trees, Swallows, Houses felt like a cousin to Don Cab or Hella, their first Barsuk outing has adapted the organic spirit of their Northwestern labelmates (particularly that of Menomena, the Long Winters, and John Vanderslice.) Of course, with Maps & Atlases' virtuosic chops and syncopated leanings, they kind of resemble BLK JKS or Minus the Bear, albeit with a Jethro Tull influence. Trendy South African rhythms and austere strings spin a web around Davidsonâs poetic lyrics, and in this intricate, introspective setting, their talent becomes very clear. ~ Jason Lymangrover","7.6","/music/perch-patchwork/maps-atlases",2010-06-29

"9366",69,"Junky Star","Ryan Bingham & the Dead Horses","Songwriter Ryan Bingham has grown tremendously on this third full-length. Barely 30 years old, his previous work showed promise but carried the excess expected of a novice. Bingham won both a Golden Globe and an Oscar for ""The Weary Kind,"" the theme song from the film Crazy Heart. The song was produced by T-Bone Burnett, creating a partnership extended on Junky Star. Bingham and his Dead Horses--drummer Matthew Smith, bassist Elijah Ford, and guitarist Corby Schaub, prove the song was no fluke. The sound is pure Americana; these 12 lyrically sophisticated yet direct songs, reflect a host of tense, lost, desperate, individuals dreaming the same dark dream, one that suggests that we are all growing tenser with the times. Bingham has trimmed his songwriting to the bone, while learing to use metaphor and metonomy like a veteran. A former rodeo rider, he wears his influences proudly: Guthrie, Dylan, Van Zandt, Ely, Earle, Clark, and Hubbard. He begins with a sandblasted vision of America in ""the Poet."" Amid acoustic guitars, a lonesome harmonica ,restrained electric and bass drum, Bingham's whiskey-smoked vocal offers a lyric theme the entire album turns on: ""As I keep walking, people keep talking/About things they've never seen or done/Homeless sleep in the park, lovers kiss in the dark/Me, I keep moving on through time."" Time is suspended as Bingham's protagonists tell stories from the road (some of them bone-chilling), from America's past and present, physically and psychologically. Rootlessness as peace of mind is portrayed via country rock in ""The Wandering,"" but the feeling in ""Strange Feeling In The Air,"" the title track, a deeply moving acoustic murder ballad (they are strewn throughout the album), and the angry uptempo ""Depression,"" reflect a contradiction: constant movement is the key to survival, not necessarily peace. ""Hallelujah"" is another murder ballad with a disturbing twist. ""Lay My Head On The Rail,"" is pure folk poetry illustrated by a lone acoustic guitar. The blues in ""Hard Worn Trail,"" are rooted in poverty worry, strained, broken relationships resulting in the search for comfort. It doesn't come anywehre on Junky Star. ""All Choked Up Again,"" set to Waylon Jennings' brand of outlaw country closes it out by mining the existential darkness deeper. Bingham is unflinching, but his songs hold out for a glimmer of something else. The only real consolation Junky Star offers is that no one need feel alone in her or his desperation-this is a true accomplishment. Bingham has delivered a set of songs that mirrors our uncertain times in a musical language that doesn't unduly distort or romanticise them. ~ Thom Jurek","tbd","/music/junky-star/ryan-bingham-the-dead-horses",2010-08-31

"9649",69,"Disconnect from Desire","School of Seven Bells","On their second album, School of Seven Bells cast themselves as an update of a specific kind of misfit band. Alpinisms reconstituted late-â80/early-â90s shoegaze. Disconnect from Desire, however, updates the sound of a kind of band that would have opened for Peter Gabriel and Eurythmics, or headlined over Revolver, rather than tour with the likes of Lush, Ride, and Pale Saints. Here, a focused songcraft and central placement of the Deheza twinsâ alluring vocals -- which tend to be lower and more earthly than they were on the debut -- disallow School of Seven Bells from being squarely shoegaze. At the same time, the band is too left of center, too odd, to be considered anywhere near the mainstream. Their cleaner, less wispy, more muscular sound, combined with more traditional songwriting, is not that radical a change. Itâs closer to a slight shift that registers after a couple spins, once it becomes apparent that deeply emotive and relatively sparse songs like âI L U,â âJoviann,â and âThe Waitâ would have made excellent tracks buried throughout Sireâs Just Say series. They have shoegaze lyric-generator staples like wind, waves, ocean, storms, and even talk of âslipping away.â And yet, the words are not merely functional, written solely for the sake of complementing the sound as an additional instrument. Theyâre either poetically vague or vaguely poetic -- stuff like âLet me will the dial to turn and gild the air with silver pearls of rainâ and âWhenâs the wait a cradle in which youâre lulled from time to time, soundly spun into an insensate lie.â The thicker, more driving songs resemble a polished, warm Curve, whipping up squalls of noise over robust played-and-programmed rhythms that soar more often than batter. No matter the amount of layering, not a single element is obscured. This vivid directness suits them very well. ~ Andy Kellman","7.4","/music/disconnect-from-desire/school-of-seven-bells",2010-07-13

"10035",68,"Come And Get It!","Eli ""Paperboy"" Reed","Ever since the dawn of the electric guitar, white boys have sung the blues, some with considerably more success than others. Eli âPaperboyâ Reed is part of that long tradition, but he stands apart from the pack as much as he belongs to it, due in large part to his age. Raised on CD reissues of classic blues and soul -- he was not even 10 when the first Complete Stax/Volt Singles box came out -- Reed has absorbed the sound and sensibility of classic â60s soul but sings without any white-boy blues affectations, totally comfortable in his own skin because nobody else his age, of any race, was attempting to make this kind of music. This can cause a kind of a disconnect -- Reed sounds so white when he sings, itâs disarming -- but he pours on the passion and has fully absorbed the tight turns of Stax and loves the sound as much as the structure, so much so that Come and Get It -- his third LP and first for a major label -- feels a bit like an unearthed relic, built on songs and sounds that could pass for unheard gems if it wasnât for Reedâs unapologetically white voice, free of affectations and ticks. Some of that may be due to producer Mike Elizondoâs work -- he manages to make this sound like a throwback without being stiff, and without having a hint of Mark Ronsonâs hipster retroism for Amy Winehouse -- but heâs just articulating Reedâs gifts, letting the songs stand front and center. And thatâs whatâs remarkable about Come and Get It: this is not a modern-day blues album, itâs a classic soul album, with almost all the tracks clocking in at 3:30 or less, leaving very little room for showboating solos. All concentration is on the tunes themselves, with the band kicking them toward kineticism, Reed channeling all his energy into making the songs sing, and they wind up sticking, sounding a bit like forgotten classics upon first listen, then winding up as familiar favorites upon the second. If there is any fault here, itâs that Reedâs voice remains perennially boyish, sometimes preventing this from achieving a level of gravity, but thereâs no attempt to hide this: itâs an honest reflection of who Reed is, a young kid from Boston in love with the Southern sounds of the â60s and intent on carrying them on, even if he invites ridicule or scorn. He believes it, man, and based on Come and Get It, itâs hard not to believe it too. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine","tbd","/music/come-and-get-it!/eli-paperboy-reed",2010-08-10
